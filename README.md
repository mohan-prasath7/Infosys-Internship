# 📚 Cyberbullying Detection Model 🌐🛡️

Welcome to the Cyberbullying Detection Model repository! This machine learning model is designed to identify instances of cyberbullying in comments. Built using **RNN** and **LSTM**, the model analyzes text data to determine whether a comment is categorized as cyberbullying or not. 

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔍 **Accurate Detection**: Leverages RNN and LSTM for sequence analysis to achieve high prediction accuracy.
- 📊 **Binary Classification**: Classifies comments into two categories — **Cyberbullying** and **Non-Cyberbullying**.
- 📄 **Dataset**: Utilizes a structured dataset with labeled comments for training and testing.
- 📈 **Scalable**: Can be adapted for various text-based moderation systems.
